<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi! I'm Aastha Bansal, a passionate full-stack developer and a 2026 graduate
  from the University Institute of Engineering and Technology (UIET). I enjoy
  building modern, scalable applications and constantly exploring new tech
  stacks and tools.
</p>

<p>
  During my college journey, I served as the Head of GDG on Campus, where I led
  a team to organize impactful events, tech sessions, workshops, and even
  hackathons that helped many students dive into real-world development. I
  strongly believe in tech communities and love contributing through mentorship,
  collaboration, and knowledge-sharing.
</p>

<p>
  I'm always excited to work on challenging projects, connect with like-minded
  developers, and contribute to the open-source community. Youâ€™ll often find me
  sharing projects and insights on LinkedIn and GitHub, helping others grow
  while learning something new myself.
